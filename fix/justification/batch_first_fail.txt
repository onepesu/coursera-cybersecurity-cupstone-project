When an invalid command was given in a batch file, and the logfile named has
not appeared previously, then we had an unhandled exception. This can be seen
in 14938_129_correctness_batch_logfile.json, where the third command in the
batch is invalid and references the logfile named TPWMVDMZ2 which has not been
mentioned before.

The fix we implemented was to change the type of the temporary dictionary we
were using to store the information to be written in the logfile, as well as
the way we handled its exceptions.
