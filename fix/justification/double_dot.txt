From our previous commit we also added the option that the logfile name could
contain references to files in other directories, namely ../<logfile name>.
We were unsure as to whether we should have included them in the
filename_validator fix as we assumed that the oracle tests on these will fail,
due to the files not being cleaned correctly in the oracle. However, we would
consider it an injustice if this was considered a different bug fix than the
previous one.

An example can be seen in 11086_129-23.json, where we previously failed to
write to ../TESTLOG1.
