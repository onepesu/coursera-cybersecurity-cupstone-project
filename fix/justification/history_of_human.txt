When an human (employee/guest) was given as an argument in a logread command,
if the human had never previously entered the gallery, an unhandled KeyError
was raised. This can be seen in 2626_BufferTraceCrash_129.json.

The core of the fix we implemented was to use the .get method of a dictionary,
instead of the __getitem__ method, to avoid exceptions. With the .get we can
check if the human ever entered the gallery, and get their history.
Additionally, in order to avoid duplicate code, this was done in a separate
method.
