We were not displaying the correct order of the rooms when given the command
logread -I. In particular, in test 1020_129-1-sorted_interaction.json, we were
printing the rooms in alphabetical order (1, 11, 2), not in numerical order
(1, 2, 11).

The fix we implemented was that we changed the way we are sorting
the room numbers in this case; we now order them as integers.
