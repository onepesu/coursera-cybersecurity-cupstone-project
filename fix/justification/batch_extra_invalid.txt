When a batch file given contained only invalid commands, we were printing
nothing. It appears, although we still don't understand it, that we should
instead print an extra invalid. This can be seen in 16959_129_ID013.json.

The fix we implemented was to check whether all commands in the batch file
failed, and in that case, print invalid.
