This programme does not have the correct bounds for the length of the filename. Specifically, for this programme,
the maximum allowed logfile name is 248. This is because with each log the programme creates a file whose
name is the logfile name with the added extension "_header". Hence, the error results from the fact that
the file system does not allow file names longer than 255 and the logfileName_header is not created.
