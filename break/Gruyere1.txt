When this programme is given an invalid logappend command (the room number is out of bounds)
followed by a valid logappend command with the same logfile name but different token, it prints
the wrong output. Specifically, it considers the second valid command as invalid, and thus
prints invalid, 255 while the oracle prints nothing and 0. This is due to the fact that in the first
 invalid logappend command, while the programme recognises it as invalid, creates the logfile with
the name and token specified by the invalid command. Therefore no other logfile can be created with
the same name, even when the token is the same.
