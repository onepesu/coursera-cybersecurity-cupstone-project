This programme handles wrongly how people are allowed to move within the gallery.
Specifically, it allows an employee/guest to arrive with two consecutive commands in two different rooms
while they must first depart from the rooms. In this test, in the first command the
employee arrives at room 1 and on the following command they arrive at room 2, while
the command should be invalid because they would first need to leave room 1.
