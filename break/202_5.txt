Program accepts the first logfile name when multiple names are given.

Specs say that:
The log file cannot be present multiple times.
and If the same argument is provided multiple times, the last value is accepted.

So logappend -T 1 -K key -G Nick -A loga20 loga21 loga22 should return invalid 255 instead of 0.
And in no way logread -S -K key loga20 should return the log status.
